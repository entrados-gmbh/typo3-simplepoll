What does it do?
================

With the release of TYPO3 6.2 we saw the need of a clean and simple poll extension.

There are others like myquizpoll but they are mostly overloaded with features and therefore not easy to use and maintain for editors.

Our goal was to keep it as simple as possible

Main Features
-------------

- easy to setup
- easy to use
- protection against multiple votes via cookies or IP address
- ajax calls for all actions - no page reload
- easy to cusomize using TypoScript and Fluid templates.
